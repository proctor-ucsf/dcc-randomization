  abstract  = "Since 1991 the BMJ has had a policy of not publishing trials
               that have not been properly randomised, except in rare cases
               where this can be justified.1 Why? The simplest approach to
               evaluating a new treatment is to compare a single group of
               patients given the new treatment with a group previously treated
               with an alternative treatment. Usually such studies compare two
               consecutive series of patients in the same hospital(s). This
               approach is seriously flawed. Problems will arise from the
               mixture of retrospective and prospective studies, and we can
               never satisfactorily eliminate possible biases due to other
               factors (apart from treatment) that may have changed over time.
               Sacks et al compared trials of the same treatments in which
               randomised or historical controls were used and found a
               consistent tendency for historically controlled trials to yield
               more optimistic results than randomised trials.2 The use of
               historical controls can be justified only in tightly controlled
               situations of relatively rare conditions, such â€¦",
