  abstract = "Recent empirical evidence supports the importance of adequate
              randomization in controlled trials. Trials with inadequate
              allocation concealment have been associated with larger treatment
              effects compared with trials in which authors reported adequate
              allocation concealment. While that provides empirical evidence of
              bias being interjected into trials, trial investigators rarely
              document the sensitive details of subverting the intended purpose
              of randomization. This article relates anonymous accounts run the
              gamut from simple to intricate operations, from transillumination
              of envelopes to searching for code in the office files of the
              principal investigator. They indicate that deciphering is
              something more frequent than a rate occurrence. These accounts
              prompt some methodological recommendations to help prevent
              deciphering. Randomized controlled trials appear to annoy human
              nature--if properly conducted, indeed they should.",

  title    = "Generation of allocation sequences in randomised trials: chance,
              not choice",
  author   = "Schulz, Kenneth F and Grimes, David A",
  abstract = "The randomised controlled trial sets the gold standard of
              clinical research. However, randomisation persists as perhaps the
              least-understood aspect of a trial. Moreover, anything short of
              proper randomisation courts selection and confounding biases.
              Researchers should spurn all systematic, non-random methods of
              allocation. Trial participants should be assigned to comparison
              groups based on a random process. Simple (unrestricted)
              randomisation, analogous to repeated fair coin-tossing, is the
              most basic of sequence generation approaches. Furthermore, no
              other approach, irrespective of its complexity and
              sophistication, surpasses simple randomisation for prevention of
              bias. Investigators should, therefore, use this method more often
              than they do, and readers should expect and accept disparities in
              group sizes. Several other complicated restricted randomisation
              procedures limit the likelihood of undesirable sample size
              imbalances in the intervention groups. The most frequently used
              restricted sequence generation procedure is blocked
              randomisation. If this method is used, investigators should
              randomly vary the block sizes and use larger block sizes,
              particularly in an unblinded trial. Other restricted procedures,
              such as urn randomisation, combine beneficial attributes of
              simple and restricted randomisation by preserving most of the
              unpredictability while achieving some balance. The effectiveness
              of stratified randomisation depends on use of a restricted
              randomisation approach to balance the allocation sequences for
              each stratum. Generation of a proper randomisation sequence takes
              little time and effort but affords big rewards in scientific
              accuracy and credibility. Investigators should devote appropriate
              resources to the generation of properly randomised trials and
              reporting their methods clearly.",
